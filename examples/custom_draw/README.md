# Custom draw
Example demonstrates how to use custom drawing functions for edge and nodes and handle animation state. Here we draw nodes as squares and adding edge labels for the standard edge shape. We also rotate node when it is in the state of dragging.

## run
```bash
cargo run --release -p custom_draw
```
